# Olist E-commerce Dataset:  
Customer Clustering & Classification

This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to analyze a brazilian e-commerce dataset. Primary objectives were: first, to cluster clients based on their purchasing behavior, and second, to classify customers likely to return.

## Dataset
This dataset was generously provided by Olist, which was made publicly accessible on kaggle.com. The dataset has information of 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow you to evaluate an order from a variety of perspectives, including order status, pricing, payment, and freight performance, as well as customer location, product qualities, and customer feedback.

## Business understanding 

**Background/ Requirements Gathering**
 - The company is an e-commerce platform that sells to multiple
   marketplaces in Brazil.
 - From 2016 to 2018, all orders placed were    recorded and one major
   business problem was detected, namely that the    majority of
   customers who placed orders did not return.

**Business/Project Objectives and Scope**
 - Gain insight into what drives people to buy our product
 - *Clustering -* Segmentation of customers per group to customize future client service.
- *Classification -* In order to predict customer’s return. The project, which spanned over one month, followed the CRISP-DM methodology.
